cervi (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Could not compile on some machines (game.cc line 326, iostream not inc.)
    (fixed by cervi-0.0.1-01.patch)
  * Added music
  * Added placing method from original cervi (now default)
  * Changed class Field so we can dynamically change its size (I didn't know
    that vector<bool> acts as bit vector, I thought it is same as vector<int>)
  * You can choose field size
  * Added hatrick and extra hatrick bonuses
  * Written `Gameplay internals' section in README
  * Rewritten antialiasing (looks really antialiased now :)
  * Some little code cleanups as usual

cervi (0.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release which has almost all features that should cervi have (all
    that I remembered) and which has fixed all bugs which I've found during
    development.
